pwr2ppl
=======

pwr2ppl contains protocols for running a wide range of power analyses. Analyses range from simple approaches such as t-test and correlations to multifactor ANOVA (between and within subjects, linear mixed model approaches) and regression-based approaches (basic multiple regression, moderated regression, mediation, and logistic regression).

These protocols accompany the book *Applied Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences (2nd ed.)*. The book should be out in 2019. The book gives lots of illustritive examples of using the code but is not necessary for using the package.
