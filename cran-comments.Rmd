## Third Resubmission

I addresed this issue by adding on.exit() to each function. I chose this option for the following reasons:

* The desired output is generally one or two sentence that explain the result.  
* The message option prints in red. Many users interpret red as meaning an error.  
* Packages with similar forms of output (i.e., not desiged to create objects that require extraction) appear to use either print or cat to carry out these tasks.  

Previous comments: "You write information messages to the console that cannot be easily
suppressed. It is more R like to generate objects that can be used to
extract the information a user is interested in, and then print() that
object. Instead of print()/cat() rather use message()/warning() if you
really have to write text to the console.

Please make sure that you do not change the user's options. If you
really have to do so, please ensure that everything is reset at the end
of evaluation by using on.exit().

Please fix and resubmit."

## Second Resumbission  

* Restructured doi format as directed.  

## Resubmission  

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Converted the description to sentence case (i.e., not capitalizing power analyses).    
* Added a citation and doi to the Description.  
* Replaced dontrun with donttest. The two wrapped examples cannot be executed in under 5 seconds.  

## Test Environments
* local Windows 10, R 3.6.0  
* win-builder (devel)  
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.0  
* OS-X 10.13 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.0

## R CMD check results

There were no Errors or Warnings.  

There is one note.  

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE. Maintainer: 'Chris Aberson <cla18@humboldt.edu>'. This is a new submission
