## Second Resumbission  

* Restructured doi format as directed.  

## Resubmission  

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Converted the description to sentence case (i.e., not capitalizing power analyses).    
* Added a citation and doi to the Description.  
* Replaced dontrun with donttest. The two wrapped examples cannot be executed in under 5 seconds.  

## Test Environments
* local Windows 10, R 3.6.0  
* win-builder (devel)  
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.0  
* OS-X 10.13 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.0
