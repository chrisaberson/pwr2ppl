This is a developmental release.

\#pwr2ppl 0.1.1

Submitted to CRAN. Accepted 6/12/19.

\#pwr2ppl 0.1.2

Updated 8/11/20

Corrected tfromd, anc, and lmm1w1b issues. Added text to clarify within
subjects and mixed design sample sizes.

Functions for mediation are expanded and improved. Expanded med to
accept 2 predictors and 4 mediators - note: the function is recommended
onyl if you use the Sobel test. Since nobody uses Sobel, use medjs
instead. medjs uses the joint significance test. med\_serial adds serial
mediation.

There is a new folder called “betafunctions” where I will post
developmental versions of functions I’m working on. My current target
for development are some of the more common conditional process
analyses.
